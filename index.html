        <h2>Introducing QuizGen, your go-to quiz generator for any text you upload! <br>
            Our inspiration stems from the need for a dynamic tool that effortlessly<br>
             creates quizzes on the fly. As authors ourselves, we often found the lack<br>
              of a versatile solution for spontaneous quiz creation. In those crucial <br>
              study moments, testing our knowledge became essential, and that's where <br>
              QuizGen comes into play! Elevate your learning experience with QuizGen <br>
              because learning should be as seamless as it is insightful.
