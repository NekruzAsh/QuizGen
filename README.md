<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: green;">Inspiration</span> <br> 
<span style="font-size: 22px;">As students, we are always trying to find better ways to study and learn new studying techniques, so creating a tool that can help us do that and increase productivity in our everyday life was in our plan.</span>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">What it does</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">In our brainstorming sessions, we came up with this idea to make studying and learning easier. Our product is a website that allows the user to select a text and ask for quiz-generated questions based on the selected text.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">How we built it</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">We built this project using Visual Studio Code. Implemented JavaScript, Cohere AI Language Model API, HTML, and CSS.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Challenges we ran into</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">We faced difficulties and challenges when we were trying to use the Chat GPT API and connecting our files in JavaScript because the keys in Chat GPT were limited.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Accomplishments that we're proud of</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">This whole experience is a great accomplishment for us. From the start of this hackathon, we decided to make a project that we were uncomfortable with. We did not know much about AI and APIs, neither of us knew JavaScript. But towards the end of the hackathon, our team knew more about AI and a new programming language and how they can be implemented in everyday life.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">What we learned</span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">At the start of this hackathon, we had an idea, but that idea was already taken and too broad. We decided to switch midway to see if we can come up with a different solution to a different category. We ended up switching our idea during midnight and once we were finished. We learned that the idea doesn't have to be broad but rather have a solution to a small but large problem.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">What's next for QuizGen</span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">Our next goal is to make our product more user-friendly, create a chrome extension, implement new and better AI models such as GPT-4, and add more features to it like user account creation and data tracking that can be stored in Cloud.</span>
