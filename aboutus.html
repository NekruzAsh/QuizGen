            <h2>3 Engineering College Students</h2>
            <p>We are 3 engineering students from the University of Cincinnati, when it came to <br>
               making a tool to help students study easier and also achieve better grades we came<br>    
               up with the idea to use an AI language model to combine with education. This would<br>
               allow us to make a tool that auto generates set of quiz questions based on text input<br>
               by the user.
            </p>
